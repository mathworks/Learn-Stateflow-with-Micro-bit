This repository provides three hands-on MATLAB LiveScripts and starter Simulink models, designed to teach students how to use Stateflow for embedded logic and interactive applications on the BBC micro:bit. Each exercise walks through the creation of a real-world project—from a digital dice roller to a step counter and a rock-paper-scissors game—while demonstrating key Stateflow concepts and embedded programming skills.

## Exercises 

### Digital Dice
**LiveScript:** Dice_HW_Instructions.mlx<br>
**Simulink Model:** Dice_HW_start_2025.slx<br>
**Description:** Create a digital dice roller. Press a button to generate and display a random number (1–6) on the micro:bit’s LED matrix.<br> 

### Step Tracker
**LiveScript:** Steps_HW_Instructions.mlx<br>
**Simulink Model:** Steps_HW_start_2025.slx<br>
**Description:** Build a step counter using Stateflow and the micro:bit’s accelerometer. Detect shakes or steps and update the display. <br>

### Rock Paper Scissors
**LiveScript:** RPS_HW_Instructions.mlx<br>
**Simulink Model:** RPS_HW_start_2025.slx<br>
**Description:** Design a Rock Paper Scissors game. Play against the micro:bit, with random choices and outcome display.<br>
